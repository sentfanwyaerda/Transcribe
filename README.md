### Roadmap
- 1) [*100%*] get the **player** operational, let **[tab]** pause and play, and [*0%*] let it load video/audio through URI (for ftp, web or local support)
- 2) [*0%*] get the **editor** to save your transcripts, including srt-files, and [*100%*] let the **player** send timestamps (when pressed **[shift][enter]**)
- 3) [*0%*] enable *cue zones* to synchronize scenes in your media with your transcript, through the timestamps and **[shift][up/down]**
- 4) [*optional*] optimize for an *auto-transcribe mode* with help of [Dragon Naturally Speaking](http://www.nuance.com/dragon/) (*propriatory*) on desktops running windows
- 5) [*extra*] introduce a view-mode: the **player** automatically skips to the next *cue zone* while playing the video

### Modules
- **player:** [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/videojs/) (*free*, Apache2 license)
- **editor:** just a simple textarea and some javascript (for now)
