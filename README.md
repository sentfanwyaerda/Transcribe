### Roadmap
- 1) get the **player** operational, and let it load video/audio through URI (for ftp, web or local support) and let **[tab]** pause and play
- 2) get the **editor** to save your transcripts, including srt-files, and let the **player** send timestamps (when pressed **[enter]**)
- 3) enable *cue zones* to synchronize scenes in your media with your transcript, through the timestamps
- 4) optimize for an *auto-transcribe mode* with help of [Dragon Naturally Speaking](http://www.nuance.com/dragon/) (*propriatory*) on desktops running windows

### Modules
- **player:** [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/videojs/) (*free*, Apache2 license)
